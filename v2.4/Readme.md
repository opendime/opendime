## Version 2.4 Opendime Sample

The files here are an example of what a V2.4.0 Opendime's filesystem
looks like, at each stage of its lifecycle.

Specifically, these files were copied from a sample unit running
version 2.4.0 of the firmware:

```
2.4.0 time=20190207.130255 git=master@e233940e coin=BTC
```

With SHA256 checksum:

```

```

## New Changes in this Version

- if the user's browser is set for language we have a translation for, we'll show that instead of English (can still override)
- blockchain explorers updated: Blocktrail removed, BC.i becomes BC.com, add Blockstream
- copyright changed to 2016-2019, added (R) to Opendime logo (it is registered now)
- changes to match v4 hardware, with "Legal Tender" text on it
- `version.txt` now includes `coin=BTC` for more certainty
- `chain.crt` has certificate chain for "Batch #4" from the factory

## Example `rngverify.py` Output

The entropy used to pick the key was recorded in `entropy.bin`
and can be verified using the code in:
`unsealed/advanced/rngverify.py`

```
% ./unsealed/advanced/rngverify.py entropy.bin

STEP1: Secret exponent is hash of things we expected (good).

SUCCESS: Private key uses secret exponent we expected. Perfect.

```
